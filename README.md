## WHO WHAT

my name is Olivia Maia; Iâ€™m a Brazilian writer, artist and sometimes the worse artisan in the history of artisanship.

agender. cat person. != girl != boy
any pronoun works.

i have _some_ git repos mirrored to github, but the actual repos are at [codeberg.org/olivia](https://codeberg.org/olivia).

i'm bad at code but i can help with EN-PT_br translations.
